## ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Create a Cloudflare Worker

## ðŸ“Œ Step 2: Set Up KV Namespace

2. Click **Create a Namespace** and name it `MESSAGES`.
3. Copy the binding name and link it to your Worker under **Variables**.

## ðŸ“Œ Step 3: Configure Variables

Define the required variables in your Cloudflare Worker:

```env
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your-bot-token
TELEGRAM_SECRET=ashlynn-repo
OPENAI_API_URL=https://api-y5s2.onrender.com/v2/chat/api

curl -X POST "https://your-worker-name.workers.dev/registerWebhook"
```

## ðŸ“Œ Step 6: Test Your Bot
